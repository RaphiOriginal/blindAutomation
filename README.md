# blindAutomation 🚀
Scripts to control blinds depending on the sun azimuth

This python code is meant to run on a raspberrypi. It searches for [Shellys](https://shelly.cloud) in the configured Networkmask and maps them with the configured Shellyids (see settings.yaml.template).
This application is build for [Shelly 2.5](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-25-smart-home-automation-relay/) in roller mode to controll your blinds. It collects the Sundata from [Meteomatics](https://www.meteomatics.com/)
It is necessary to have the shellys calibrated for it runtimes to get it working correctly, otherwise it might just stops in the middle of the window.

## Configuration settings.yaml 🎛
copy and rename [settings.yaml.template](https://github.com/RaphiOriginal/blindAutomation/blob/master/settings.yaml.template) to settings.yaml and update the properties:
* meteomatics: Meteomatics api credentials
  * username: from Meteomatics
  * password: from Meteomatics
  * coordinates: coordinates of wall (i recommend to pick a corner of two walls) I did mine with the help of [SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/#/46.0162,8.4421,3/2020.07.27/19:54/1/1)
    * lat: Latitude
    * long: Longitude
* api: Which api you want to use (meteomatics is recommended here)
* networkmask: where to to search for shellys
* walls:
  * wall:
    * name: where the wall is (can be any name, e.g. 'south' or 'green wall'')
    * in: When the sun azimuth starts to hit the wall
    * out: When the sun azimuth stops to hit the wall
* shellys: list of shellys
  * shelly:
    * name: How you'd like to name the shelly to recognise it in text outputs
    * id: Shellyid (can be found in the shelly app in settings) usualy last 6 characters of macadress
    * direction: At which wall is the shelly located (must match with a name from walls)
    * triggers: List of triggers you'd like to apply for the shelly
      * SUNRISE: Will open the blinds on sunrise
        * task: (optional) default is OPEN
      * SUNSET: Will close the blinds on sunset
        * task: (optional) default is CLOSE
      * SUNIN: Will tilt the blinds when the azimuth of the sun passes the azimuth defined for the related wall
        * task: (optional) default is TILT
      * SUNOUT: Will open the blinds when the azimuth of the sun passes the azimuth defined for the related wall
        * task: (optional) default is OPEN
      * TIME: Add a Task (OPEN, CLOSE, TILT) you want at a given time, will be run at this time daily
        * task: (mandatory) Can be OPEN, CLOSE or TILT. Tilt will close the blind completle and then open for around 2%
        * time: (mandatory) Time when the task should be triggered in the HH:MM:SS format

## Meteomatics ☀️
You have to get access to the meteomatics api and update your logins in the settings.yaml

## Run 🏃
I recommend to run this scripts with cronjob. It will collect all task for a full day, and after the day is over, it will finish and needs to be started again.
Due to the nature of the Meteomatics API i recommend to time your Fetch for your day after midnight utc if possible (e.g. 03:00 for MEZ) but before the first Task should be applied.

you can edit crontab with e.g. nano:
`$ crontab -e`

Add cronjobs:
```
0 3     * * *   root    python3 ~/blindAutomation/app.py
```

It is also recommended to start the script after a reboot to get the magic ongoing e.g. after a power outage.
To achieve this, we use systemd.

you can start configure your service with:
`sudo systemctl edit --force --full blindAutomation.service`

and entering following configurations into the file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Blind Automation Service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi
ExecStart=/home/pi/blindAutomation/app.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
WantedBy=network-online.service
```
