# blindAutomation üöÄ
Scripts to control blinds depending on the sun azimuth or weather without sensors!

This python code is meant to run on a raspberrypi. It searches for [Shellys](https://shelly.cloud) in the local Network and maps them with the configured Shellyids (see settings.yaml.template).
This application is build for [Shelly 2.5](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-25-smart-home-automation-relay/) in roller mode to control your blinds. It calculates the Sundata with [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
It is necessary to have the shellys calibrated for it opening and close times to get it working correctly, otherwise it might just stops in the middle of the window or does not move at all.

For the Weather data is an account and api key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) necessary. A Free Subscription is enough to get it working!
The API key must be configured as environment variable `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` on the run environment.

## Configuration settings.yaml üéõ
copy and rename [settings.yaml.template](https://github.com/RaphiOriginal/blindAutomation/blob/reorganisation/data/settings.yaml.template) to settings.yaml and update the properties.

### Main information
There are some main information necessary like location data and timezone.
#### Location
For proper calculation the application needs your location as precise as possible:
* `coordinates:`
  * `lat:` Latitude of the building
  * `long:` Longitude of the building
  * `alt:` Altitude of the location
##### Example
```
coordinates:
  lat: 47.3916
  long: 8.0512
  alt: 365
```
#### API
* `api:` Defines which api should be used to calculate sundata. I recommend pvlib which will run on your device.
  * Possible values are `pvlib` or `mock`, where mock is only for testing purposes where sunrise is 30 seconds after api call and all degrees are 30 seconds apart from each other.
##### Example
```
api: pvlib
```
#### Timezone
* `timezone:` define which timezone you're to match correct times e.g. for the `TIME`trigger.
  * Check possible values on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in the 'TZ database name' column.
##### Example
```
timezone: 'Europe/Zurich'
```
#### Main information example
```
coordinates:
  lat: 47.3916
  long: 8.0512
  alt: 365
api: pvlib
timezone: 'Europe/Zurich'
```
### Building data
To be able to get all the times correct for example for the `SUNIN` and `SUNOUT` trigger, are some data of the building needes.
#### Walls
Of course has every building some walls where possible shutters to be configured are. That's why we need some data for each wall with shutter you'd like to manage.
* `walls:` holds list of walls that you want to controll
#### Wall
Holds data like when the sun will enter and leafe the wall. On an open field without other buildings or trees at a straight wall, that should be a range about 180¬∞ between those properties. Of course with other buildings making shadow, it can be less.
* `wall:` holds the actual data for a wall
  * Properties are `name`, `in`, `out`, `blinds`
  * `name:` To give the wall a name for better management and log output.
  * `in:` Azimuth when the sun would enter the wall.
    * Value must be between `0`¬∞ and `360`¬∞.
  * `out:` Azimuth when the sun would leave the wall.
    * Value must be between `0`¬∞ and `360`¬∞.
  * `blinds:` List of blind` that are build into the wall.
#### Blind
The `blind` property holds the actual date about the blind and it's device that controls the blind.
* `name:` Name of the blind some thing like 'Kitchen'
* `in:` (optional) Overrides the wall azimuth for sun income trigger
    * Value must be between `0`¬∞ and `360`¬∞.
* `out:` (optional) Overrides the wall azimuth for sun outgoing trigger
    * Value must be between `0`¬∞ and `360`¬∞.
* `device-id:` ID of the device
  * string
* `device-typ:` Defines which device controlls the blind
  * Possible values are `SHELLY`
* `tilt-time:` (optional) Overrides the time in seconds the blind needs to tilt from 90¬∞ to 0¬∞
  * If not set the default value is 1.2 seconds
* `triggers:` List that holds the trigger
  * List of `trigger` for example `SUNRISE` or `SUNOUT`
* `events:` List that holds the event
  * List of `event` for example `CLOUDY` or `WIND`
#### Example
For an example of those properties or more please take a look at [settings.yaml.template](https://github.com/RaphiOriginal/blindAutomation/blob/master/settings.yaml.template).
### Tasks
Tasks defines the actual work that is possible to do. Following tasks are available:
* `OPEN` Opens the blinds
* `CLOSE` Closes the blinds
* `TILT` Will tilt the blinds
You can define how much the blind should tilt by passing a degree value between `0`¬∞ and `90`¬∞, where `0`¬∞ means fully tilt and `90`¬∞ means closed.
Example:
```
task: 
  TILT: 45
```
This will tilt the task for 45¬∞.

with:
```
task: TILT
```
the default degree of `0`¬∞ will be applied.
### Triggers
Triggers are either a list of strings where each trigger just uses its default values, or trigger objects. String and objects triggers can be mixed in the list.
Available triggers are:
* `SUNRISE` Will open the blind at sunrise
* `SUNSET` Will close the blind at sunset
* `SUNIN` Will tilt the blind when sun passes configured wall or device azimuth
* `SUNOUT` Will open the blind when sun passes configured wall or device azimuth
* `TIME` Will trigger the configured task when configured time is passed
* `AZIMUTH` Will trigger the configured task when defined azimuth is passed by the sun
* `ELEVATION` Will trigger the configured task when defined elevation is passed by the sun
* `POSITION` Will trigger the configured task when defined azimuth and defined elevation is passed by the sun

How triggers are represented in the settings.yaml file:
```

### Events
Events are basically triggers too. But they can't be calculated becaus we can't see when they happens in advance.
Similar to triggers are events also in a list as string or object representation.
The weather is checked every three minutes and will therefore activate or deactivate the events depending on the weather status.
####Weather based events
Following weather based events are available:
* `CLOUDY` Will open the blinds on a cloudy day ‚òÅÔ∏è
* `RAIN` Will open the blinds on a rainy day üåß

## Running and Installation üèÉüèó
##### Balena.io
After you downloaded the project and prepared your settings file, the easiest way to do it is by deploying it with [balena](https://www.balena.io/os)
Follow getting started and after all the preparation is done and your RaspberryPi 4 is reachable over the network, simpli go to the project root folder in the terminal and use following command:
```
$balena push yourDevice.local
```
the app will fetch sundata for the actual date and if this results in no tasks, it will do it for the following date. after the work is done, it will exit and the container will restart it self and we fetch again tasks for the next day üí™
I recommend to use balena cloud for better device management even outside of your local network.
