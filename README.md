# blindAutomation üöÄ
Scripts to control blinds depending on the sun azimuth

This python code is meant to run on a raspberrypi. It searches for [Shellys](https://shelly.cloud) in the local Network and maps them with the configured Shellyids (see settings.yaml.template).
This application is build for [Shelly 2.5](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-25-smart-home-automation-relay/) in roller mode to controll your blinds. It calculates the Sundata with [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
It is necessary to have the shellys calibrated for it runtimes to get it working correctly, otherwise it might just stops in the middle of the window.

## Configuration settings.yaml üéõ
copy and rename [settings.yaml.template](https://github.com/RaphiOriginal/blindAutomation/blob/master/settings.yaml.template) to settings.yaml and update the properties:

## Running and Installation üèÉüèó
##### Balena.io
After you downloaded the project and prepared your settings file, the easiest way to do it is by deploying it with [balena](https://www.balena.io/os)
Follow getting started and after all the preparation is done and your RaspberryPi 4 is reachable over the network, simpli go to the project root folder in the terminal and use following command:
```
balena push yourDevice.local
```
the app will fetch sundata for the actual date and if this results in no tasks, it will do it for the following date. after the work is done, it will exit and the container will restart it self and we fetch again tasks for the next day üí™
I recommend to use balena cloud for better device management even outside of your local network.
